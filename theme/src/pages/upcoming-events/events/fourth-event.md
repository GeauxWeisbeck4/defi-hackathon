## Lyrics

EdEddnEddy
JID
Me and my two niggas be like Ed Edd and Eddy
I'm Zack, you AC, that Jessie and Kelly
I pull up to your hood just let me know when you ready
I'm rolling up this dub, finna face it, beheaded
Hold on, chill out, please give me a second
I'm drowsy off a xan, nigga, legs like spaghetti
Cut all of the bullshit, nigga chop the confetti
You ready? I'm ready, you ready? I'm ready
Never sell weed 'cause I'm smoke it too much
I fuck up the pack, I don't fuck with the sack
And I mean the bread come quick
He told me bring him 300, I brought him excuses and like 200 or something
I mean most of ya'll niggas love drugs like me
Love me like drugs, bitch I might be
Yo love light bulb, turn on lights please
Turn off your cool, I mean, I might freeze
I mean hold on, relax, please give me a chance
I was moving too fast, I ain't hear what you said
We was celebrating life, tryna get to the fetty
But me and my two niggas we like Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Me and my two niggas be like Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Me and my two niggas be like Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Me and my two niggas be like Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Ed, Edd, and Eddy
Me and my two niggas be like Ed, Edd, and Eddy
