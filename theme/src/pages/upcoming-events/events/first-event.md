## Lyrics
Came out bustin', came out puffin', came out fuckin' on your cousin
I do all these floozies worser than they daddy, but you love her
You in trouble, I'm lil' Sunny, I'm gon' barbecue or somethin'
That's yo' Benzy? It ain't shit, I went shoppin', left it runnin'
Check my hunnids, check my onion, we watch cable at my auntie's
'Cause my papa wasn't trappin', but my uncle up to somethin'
Mister magic Billy Batson, mister magic Billy Batson
Miss me with that loco, hatin' on a nigga, get it crackin'
I'm not surprised, I'm on the rise, been on the ride, wet as my eyes
Spare me the lie, just hold it down, all I require, just hold it down
They gon' shit talk you when we aren't around
Niggas be hatin' with feet on the ground
Got that lil' jet with a beat on the couch
Nut on her coochie and beat on her mouth, wow
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (came out bustin')
Came out bustin' (hold on), came out bustin' (wait)
Came out bustin' (hold on), came out bustin' (wait)
Came out bustin' (hold on), came out bustin' (wait)
Came out bustin' (hold on), came out bustin' (wait, uh)
Chanel on my feet (yeah), yeah, that's fur on my C's (yeah, cuz)
I be fuckin' with the B's (blatt), like Muhammad Ali (woah)
Dip her, uppercut this thing (huh?)
Got yo' bitch on the edge of her seat (ayy)
She on the ecstasy, I'm on the bean (what?)
Swear on the ecstasy, edge of my V (skrrt)
And usually, I like repetitive beat (yes)
I like the way that she move on my meat (okay)
All of these bitches, they look good to me (yeah)
But I fuck the same girl 'cause I don't even cheat (shh)
That is a lie, I'm repetitive freak (hahaha)
I don't even look, nah, I don't even seek (uh-uh)
I don't even peek, G5, G5, repetitive G (ayy)
I'm tryna get all the muhfuckin' cheese (ayy)
Bitch, I'ma boss, I'm wherever you be (yeah)
I've been on tour, I've seen more (leak)
I told these muhfuckers, "Feed me beats"
Just like my music, your bitch, she gon' leak
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
I'm road runnin', I'm so cunnin', hi-tech digit, flat four button
Passport shawty, airport prolly, NASCAR, Audi, Swanton bomb it
Two white bitches, still gon' pick it, fly shit, kick it, still tote digit
Young like slizzy, get back witcha
Step back, hit 'em with the step back, swish it
Hatin' nigga hopin' that he melt my glisten
Shit might triple, shit might missile
Shit might hit you, free G Walker
That my crodie, that my nigga
I been stackin' for him, really
When he pull up, they gon' that that
He went platinum up in prison
I'm just floatin' on a river
Please be early, please be gorgeous
Please be with it, please be for it
Let me do donuts in your foreign
Let me play number eight while I do it
Let me control it, I can control it
Eat it with one hand, baby worth nothin'
Play with my zipper, play with my bubba
That was your sister, that was my summer
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (ayy, ayy, ayy, it's ya boy)
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (DJ Mister Lou, we here again)
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (another Saturday night)
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (at Mulberry Skate, man)
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (uh, make sure you make your way to the snack bar)
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (we got, uh, honey buns, uh)
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (hot chips and cheese, uh)
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (Kool-aid pickles, uh)
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (we got everything, just make sure you don't eat on the skate floor)
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (I repeat, do not eat on the stake floor)
Came out bustin', came out bustin' (we ain't got time to be slippin' on no cheese and chicken)
Came out bustin', came out bustin'
Came out bustin', came out bustin
