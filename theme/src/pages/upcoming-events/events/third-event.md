## Lyrics

DJ, what kind soup you making?
AYOCHARLIE, man, AY CHARLIE man
How do we get views like these kids man?
They gettin' million, billion views
Facebook live's and Instagram likes and, you feelin' me?
How do we, how do we capitalize bro?
How do we internetize bro?
How do we digitalize bro?

Hook: Spark Master Tape
They said, They said They said Charlie
Get yourself a motherfuckkin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfucin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’…

Verse 1
Uhh, I said gangbangalanginslangin’
Backed by a band of orangutans
Highly ranked, military class has-beens on a mission
Manifested by the motive to make ends, in a glass roof benz
Cruisin’ cautious, the city is mine
No code of honor, If it’s pretty and I want it it’s mine
See I was raised by a quarter and a nickel and dime
So all I pay is what I play and say the currency times
See makin’ money
Make my day it’s all mutual
All I ever say "I'm ready dog, this is future proof"
Talk slick, leave ‘em blue, leave ‘em like a Subaru
Come and find ‘em, just to see what 22’s can do

Hook: Spark Master Tape
They said Charlie
Get yourself a motherfuckin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’…

Verse 2: Spark Master Tape
Genetically, aesthetically
I’m a different pedigree
Rude boi wanna jump get shot like a penalty
Got cilantro and all my hoe make the celery
Lyrically and alphabetically y'all makin' 10 of me
The recipe of damage
Hennessy n' cabbage
Mixed with ketamine a Goyard in the Vanquish
I been on the road from Catalina to New Hampton
All I eat is dead MC, the breakfast of a champion
Fuck a boat we sinkin’ every single thing you got
Fuck a boat we sinkin’ every single thing you got
Shit em all they similar to Sinaloa
Kill a mob, send em off
Sinister intentions, every single thought
Fuck 'Em, Spark Master Tape the God (what kind of soup you making?)

Hook: Spark Master Tape
Get yourself a motherfuckin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’…
They said Charlie
Get yourself a motherfuckin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’ iPhone
Get yourself a motherfuckin’…
